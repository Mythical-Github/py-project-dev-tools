# python_project_developer_tools
A better readme will be around in the future\
For now, this assumes you have hatch, and git already installed\
the tools expect the ini to be configured for your project repo\
additionally it expects a properly setup pyproject.toml for use with Hatch\
You can use this projects ini, and toml as references
